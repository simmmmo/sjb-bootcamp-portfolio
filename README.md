# Week two Assignment - sjb-bootcamp-portfolio

This weeks assignment was to develop a website based off the provided design files and that meets the acceptance criteria. From the supplied degisn mock we used HTML and CSS to develpoe a single page portfolio that is responsive for all devices. 

## Questions/Challenges

I intially style the site using the grid method and then revised and cut down the css using flexbox. Too a while to get working and as i practiced more with it i was able to simpliy the CSS further. I would be keen to get feedback on how it is now and if i have implemented it correctly.
