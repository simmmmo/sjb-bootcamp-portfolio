# Update Portfolio

Update personal portfolio with the latest course assignments.

## Notes

I am in contact with career services who are helping me adapt my past resume to be relevant to my new career goal of being a software developer.
I have used placeholder images for the portfolio and profile picture, these will be updated once i have examples of work and resume information.
